# BarnesHut
Simulate and animate n-body gravitational interactions using the Barnes-Hut algorithm. The BarnesHut class can be used to simulate the motion of gravitational bodies. The Animator and Exporter class can be used with a Simulator object to respectively visualze or export into a JSON output file the the trajectories of the simulation.


## Getting Started
Here are some useful links on the Barnes-Hut algorithm:

For getting started on implementing the algirithm, [this page](http://beltoforion.de/article.php?a=barnes-hut-galaxy-simulator) contains helful explanations and pseudocode, and [this page](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall03/cs126/assignments/barnes-hut.html) contains a helpful API, some of which influenced this implementation.
