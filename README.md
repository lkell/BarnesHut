# BarnesHut
Simulate and animate n-body gravitational interactions using the Barnes-Hut algorithm. The BarnesHut class can be used to simulate the motion of gravitational bodies. The Animator and Exporter class can be used with a Simulator object to respectively visualze or export into a JSON output file the the trajectories of the simulation.

Here are some useful links on the Barnes-Hut algorithm:
